Multithreading In Java:
Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in
parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A
simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
But, if the programming language supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
in parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.

* We can use multithreading in two different ways:
1. By extending the Thread class.
2. By implementing the Runnable interface.

Note:-  by implementing the Runnable interface is recommended. Because if we extend the Thread class then we are not
able to extend any other class.
