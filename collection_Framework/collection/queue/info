The interface Queue is available in the java.util package and does extend the Collection interface. It is used to
keep the elements that are processed in the First In First Out (FIFO) manner. It is an ordered list of objects,
 where insertion of elements occurs at the end of the list, and removal of elements occur at the beginning of the list.

              Methods of Java Queue Interface
Method	Description
boolean add(object)=>	It is used to insert the specified element into this queue and return true upon success.
boolean offer(object)=>	It is used to insert the specified element into this queue.
Object remove()=>	It is used to retrieves and removes the head of this queue.
Object poll()=>	It is used to retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
Object element()=>	It is used to retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.
Object peek()=>	It is used to retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue
is empty.

Methods of Java Deque Interface:-
Method	Description
boolean add(object)=>	It is used to insert the specified element into this deque and return true upon success.
boolean offer(object)=>	It is used to insert the specified element into this deque.
Object remove()=>	It is used to retrieve and removes the head of this deque.
Object poll()=>	It is used to retrieve and removes the head of this deque, or returns null if this deque is empty.
Object element()=>	It is used to retrieve, but does not remove, the head of this deque.
Object peek()=>	It is used to retrieve, but does not remove, the head of this deque, or returns null if
this deque is empty.

Object peekFirst()=>	The method returns the head element of the deque. The method does not remove any element
from the deque. Null is returned by this method, when the deque is empty.

Object peekLast()=>	The method returns the last element of the deque. The method does not remove any element
from the deque. Null is returned by this method, when the deque is empty.

Boolean offerFirst(e)=>	Inserts the element e at the front of the queue. If the insertion is successful,
 true is returned; otherwise, false.

Object offerLast(e)=>	Inserts the element e at the tail of the queue. If the insertion is successful,
true is returned; otherwise, false.
