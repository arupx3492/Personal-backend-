Set in Java
The set is an interface available in the java.util package. The set interface extends the Collection interface.
 An unordered collection or list in which duplicates are not allowed is referred to as a collection interface.
 The set interface is used to create the mathematical set. The set interface use collection interface's methods to
 avoid the insertion of the same elements. SortedSet and NavigableSet are two interfaces that extend the set
 implementation.
